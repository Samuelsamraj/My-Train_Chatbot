# My-Train_Chatbot
MyTrain Chatbot simplifies accessing Indian train schedules via text/voice input with multi-language support. It retrieves train options, offers seat preferences, rectifies errors, and recommends alternatives, enhancing travel planning and user experience.

# MyTrain Chatbot

MyTrain Chatbot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to facilitate users in accessing Indian train time table information conveniently. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for retrieving accurate and relevant train schedule details through text or voice inputs.

## Problem Statement

The objective of the MyTrain Chatbot project is to develop an AI-powered chatbot that prompts users for input regarding the "from" and "to" locations in multiple regional languages, as well as their seat/coach preferences (Optional), through text or audio inputs. Based on this input, the chatbot retrieves and displays all available trains on that route.

## Features

- **Text and Voice Input**: Users can interact with the chatbot through text messages or voice commands in multiple languages.
- **Location Selection**: Users specify their origin and destination stations.
- **Train Information Retrieval**: The chatbot retrieves information on available trains between the specified locations, including train name and number, departure and arrival times, travel duration, and seat availability (if possible).
- **Seat/Coach Preference (Optional)**: Users can provide their preferred seat/coach type.
- **Rectification and Recommendations**: Identify bugs in Disha 2.0 and rectify those in the Rail Chatbot. Additionally, recommend alternative nearby stations if direct trains are unavailable.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interacts with users in a natural and engaging manner, providing clear instructions and informative responses.
- **Error Handling**: Handles erroneous inputs gracefully, guiding users to correct their input or provide clarifications as needed.

## Project Workflow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the Rail Chatbot by entering text-based queries or speaking voice commands for train time table information.
2. **Input Processing**: The chatbot processes user inputs using NLP techniques to understand the user's intent and extract relevant information.
3. **Data Retrieval**: Retrieves the train time table data based on the user's input parameters.
4. **Response Generation**: Generates a response containing the available trains, their schedules, seat availability (optional), Nearby stations, and coach types (optional) matching the user's criteria.
5. **User Feedback**: Users can provide feedback on the provided information, enabling continuous improvement of the chatbot's accuracy and performance.
